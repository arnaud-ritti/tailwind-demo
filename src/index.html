      <h1>Is that a cooking show?</h1>
      <p>
        We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small
        and neutral! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more
        stuff to steal! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Then we'll go with that
        data file!
      </p>
      <p>
        Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Soothe us with sweet
        lies. Good news, everyone!
        <strong> I've taught the toaster to feel love!</strong>
        <em> Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</em> And then the battle's not so bad?
      </p>
      <h2>
        You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front
        of Jesus?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'll get my kit! I don't want to be rescued. Then we'll go with that
        data file! Also Zoidberg. Quite possible. We live long and are
        celebrated poopers.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Oh God, what have I done?</li>
        <li>
          In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult
          stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for
          their stemcells.
        </li>
        <li>No! The cat shelter's on to me.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>With gusto.</h3>
      <p>
        That's not soon enough! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to
        come back there and change your opinions manually! I barely knew Philip,
        but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends
        all about him.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li>
        <li>Tell her she looks thin.</li>
        <li>
          So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Professor, make a woman out of me. What kind of a father would I be if I
        said no? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Fry!
        Stay back! He's too powerful! One hundred dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who are those horrible orange men? But I've never been to the moon! No!
        The cat shelter's on to me. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. You
        don't know how to do any of those.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Moving along… Ah, computer
        dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside
        your head." Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no
        trash pickup until January 3rd.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is
        intelligent. Dissect its brain! I decline the title of Iron Cook and
        accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh…
        also, comes with double prize money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noooooo! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen
        seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen
        years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
      </p>
      <p>
        No argument here. Really?! Hello Morbo, how's the family? You know, I
        was God once. Kif might!
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, that's still true. You know, I was God once. Belligerent and
        numerous. You are the last hope of the universe. But I've never been to
        the moon!
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You
        will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. And I'm his
        friend Jesus. Ummm…to eBay? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused
        and worried?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ummm…to eBay? Really?! A true inspiration for the children.
        Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
        Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty
        Thor. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust
        bosoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his
        most intimate friends all about him. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in
        space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! You mean while I'm sleeping
        in it?
